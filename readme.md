-----
pyoof is a Python pacakge that contains all needed tools to perform out-of-focus (OOF) holography on astronomical beam maps for single dish radio telescopes. It is based on the original OOF holography [theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0612249) and [software](https://github.com/bnikolic/oof) developed by [Bojan Nikolic](http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~bn204/oof/).
