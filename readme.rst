pyoof is a Python pacakge that contains all needed tools to perform out-of-focus (OOF) holography on astronomical beam maps for single dish radio telescopes. It is based on the original software developed by [Bojan Nikolic](https://github.com/bnikolic/oof) and explained throughout his two papers [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0612249) [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0612241)
